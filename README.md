To run a simple "Hello World" Python script using Jupyter Notebook inside a development container (Devcontainer) with Docker, you'll need to set up a `Dockerfile` and a `devcontainer.json` configuration. Here's how you can do it:

### 1. **Create a Dockerfile**
This Dockerfile will set up the necessary Python environment and install Jupyter.

```Dockerfile
# Use the official Python base image
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Install required system packages
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    build-essential \
    curl \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Install Jupyter Notebook
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir jupyter

# Expose port 8888 for Jupyter
EXPOSE 8888

# Set up a command to run Jupyter when the container starts
CMD ["jupyter", "notebook", "--ip=0.0.0.0", "--allow-root", "--no-browser"]
```

### 2. **Create a `devcontainer.json` Configuration**
This file will set up the development environment in VS Code, defining the workspace and configuring the container.

```json
{
    "name": "Python DevContainer",
    "dockerFile": "Dockerfile",
    "context": ".",
    "appPort": [8888],
    "extensions": [
        "ms-python.python",
        "ms-azuretools.vscode-docker"
    ],
    "postCreateCommand": "pip install --no-cache-dir jupyter",
    "settings": {
        "python.pythonPath": "/usr/local/bin/python"
    }
}
```

### 3. **Create a `hello_world.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook**
In the `/app` directory of your container, create a simple notebook with the following content:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

### 4. **Run the Devcontainer**

1. Open VS Code and ensure the Remote - Containers extension is installed.
2. Open the folder where you have the `Dockerfile` and `devcontainer.json`.
3. Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P), and select **Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container**.
4. This will build the Docker image, create the container, and install the necessary extensions.
5. After the container is up and running, open the terminal inside VS Code and start Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

6. You can access the Jupyter Notebook in your browser by visiting `http://localhost:8888/`.

And boom! You'll be greeted by your glorious "Hello, World!"â€”and you can bask in the glow of your successful Dockerized Jupyter Notebook setup! ðŸŽ‰
